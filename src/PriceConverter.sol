// line abv crucial for integrating Chainlink price feeds into a Solidity smart contract.
// Specifically, it allows the smart contract to interact with Chainlink's decentralized oracle network to fetch off-chain data, such as asset prices, in a reliable and secure manner.
// AggregatorV3Interface: This is the interface that defines the functions and events required to interact with a Chainlink aggregator contract. The aggregator contract collects and aggregates data from multiple oracles to provide a reliable data feed.

Each variable provides important context about the price data, including when it was reported, which round it was part of, and the actual value (answer) itself. This information is essential for ensuring that the data used by your smart contract is accurate, timely, and reliable, especially in scenarios where the timing of the data could influence the outcomes of financial transactions or other smart contract functions.
