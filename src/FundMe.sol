        // payable is a keyword in Solidity that marks an address as capable of receiving Ether. By using payable(msg.sender), you're casting msg.sender to a payable address type, which is required to send Ether to this address.
        //    address(this) refers to the address of the current contract.
        // .balance is a property that returns the amount of Ether (in wei) currently held by the contract.

        //  3. USING CALL
        //Flexibility: call is highly flexible and can be used to send Ether and invoke functions on other contracts. Unlike transfer and send, call allows sending more than 2300 gas if needed.
        //Gas Limit: It forwards all available gas unless specified otherwise, which can potentially lead to reentrancy attacks if not used carefully.
        //Error Handling: call returns a boolean indicating success (true) or failure (false). However, if you donâ€™t handle the return value properly, it may lead to silent failures.
